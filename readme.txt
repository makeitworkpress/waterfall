== Description ==

Waterfall is an versatile, multipurpose theme that houses many options and configurations. 
From responsive logos, changing layouts for any post type, to modifying colors and typography.

Waterfall integrates well with page-builders such as elementor, and of course the default Gutenberg editor of WordPress. It also supports
bbPress, WooCommerce and the events calendar.

Waterfall is crafted for developers to easily modify templates, add custom fields, register post types and taxonomies and enqueue scripts.
Waterfall is using a modular structure using atoms and molecules, so that layout can also be easily changed without duplicating templates.
